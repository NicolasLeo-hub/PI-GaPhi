Accurate detection of foot-floor contact during gait analysis is crucial for estimating spatio-temporal gait parameters. Variability in the sequence of gait phases (HFPS) is also a key factor in assessing fall risk among the elderly and pathological subjects. This repository introduces ```PI-GaPhI```, an approach designed for automatic and user-independent classification of gait cycle phases based on pressure insoles signals.

Although the use of force platforms and instrumented walkways is direct well-established gold standards approach in this field, it is costly, non-portable, and confined to laboratory environments. Instrumented plantar insoles (pressure insoles) including only sixteen force sensing resistor elements offer a valid alternative, overcoming these limitations.

```PI-GaPhI``` is a robust tool for the accurate and efficient classification of gait phases from pressure insoles data.


## What the ```PI-GaPhI``` algorithm does:
1.	Load and convert INDIP text file (".txt") into a MATLAB matrix;
2.	Detect Gait Cycle Phases from anatomic clustering of channels of PI;
3.	Visualize results.

## Files description
The following files are provided within the GitHub repository:
- PI-GaPhI: Main function that guides you through all the main steps of Gait Cycle Phases detection;
- openINDIP.m: Function that imports an INDIP text file (".txt") into a MATLAB matrix;
- INDIP#098_28-05-2024_132036.txt: INDIP .txt file containing representative data acquired from pressure insole and other sensors of a healthy subject during locomotion.
- HFPTSdetect: Function containing detection of gait cycle phases from clustering of pressure insoles channels according to anatomic regions of foot. It consists of:
  1. Individuate Activation Windows (AW) of each PI channel: first define AW according to the noise amplitude of PI signals and then make AW control based on Neighborhood. In order to prevent possible activation spikes due to acquisition error, a channel is considered "active" if almost three channels of its neighborhood are 'active'.
  2. Individuate AW of each PI cluster: define four clusters according to four different anatomic points of foot (in order Heel, 5th metatarsal head, 1st metatarsal head and Thumb). A cluster is considered 'active' when almost one of its channels is active.
  3. Identify gait phases: define correspondence between the combination of 'active' or 'not active' clusters and a specific gait phase;
              'H': cluster1 'active', cluster2, cluster3 and cluster4 'not active';
              'F': cluster1 'active' and almost one among cluster2, cluster3 or cluster4 'active';
              'P': cluster1 'not active' and almost one among cluster2, cluster3 o cluster4 'active';
              'T': only cluster4 'active';
              'S': no cluster 'active';
  4. Segment in Gait Cycle (GC) and save results: a GC starts a cycle begins at the first detection of foot contact.  If there are two consecutive transitions, only the first one is considered as a valid cycle start.


## How to prepare your data
INDIP data must be in .txt format to fit the analysis framework.
