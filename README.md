# PI-GAPhi
Accurate detection of foot-floor contact during gait analysis is crucial for estimating spatio-temporal gait parameters. Variability in the sequence of gait phases (HFPS) is also a key factor in assessing fall risk among the elderly and pathological subjects. This repository introduces PI-GaPhI, an approach designed for automatic and user-independent classification of gait cycle phases based on pressure insoles signals.
Although the use of force platforms and instrumented walkways is direct well-established gold standards approach in this field, it is costly, non-portable, and confined to laboratory environments. Instrumented plantar insoles (pressure insoles) including only sixteen force sensing resistor elements offer a valid alternative, overcoming these limitations.
PI-GaPhI is a robust tool for the accurate and efficient classification of gait phases from pressure insoles data.
